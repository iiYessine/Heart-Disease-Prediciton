# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **machine learning classification system** designed to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient medical data.

The model analyzes clinical features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and exercise-related indicators to assist in early risk detection.

## 🎯 Problem Type

This is a **binary classification problem**:

- **Presence** → The patient has heart disease  
- **Absence** → The patient does not have heart disease
